                <h1>What is it?</h1>
                <p>Astrology is a practice that studies how the alignment of planets has or will, impact human lives. Where the planets are located will correlate with how aspects of your life will go and whether or not certain events will happen. Vedic astrology is derived from the Vedas, an old Indian scripture that contains hymns, philosophy, and ritual practices. </p>

                <h1>Misconceptions:</h1>
                <p>Western astrology studies birth charts and how they reveal people’s personality traits. People sometimes default to astrology to excuse why a person would behave a certain way.
                    <br>
                    Vedic Astrology is used for predictive means. Professional Vedic astrologers are able to predict certain big life events depending on which “house” the planets are in.

                <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
                <p>It's all based on a Vedic Chart. Vedic charts are created by intersecting diagonal lines that create a total of twelve diamonds. Each of these diamonds are referred to as a house.
                    Each house controls a different aspect of life. When a planet is located in one of these houses, it will determine what will happen in regards to the correlating aspect of life.

                    There are a total of twelve houses. Each of the circles below represents one of the houses. All of the information was derived from multiple sources that had minute differences. As a result, the sources used were then cross compared with each other in order to compile the most common factors that are affected by each Vedic house. Hover over them!
